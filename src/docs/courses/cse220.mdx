description: System Fundamentals I
---

This course will introduce assembly language programming and essential concepts of computer organization and architecture. The focus of this course is on the computer organization of a computer system, including the processor architecture and the memory system. In particular, we will discuss the internal representation of information, performance evaluation methodology, instruction set architectures and implementation techniques for computer arithmetic, control path design, and pipelining.
