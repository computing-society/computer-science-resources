title: CSE 303 - Introduction to the Theory of Computation
description: Introduction to the Theory of Computation
---

An introduction to the abstract notions encountered in machine computation. Topics include finite automata, regular expressions, and formal languages, with emphasis on regular and context-free grammars. Questions relating to what can and cannot be done by machines are covered by considering various models of computation, including Turing machines, recursive functions, and universal machines.
