title: CSE 306 - Operating Systems
description: Operating Systems
---

Students are introduced to the structure of modern operating systems. Topics include virtual memory, resource allocation strategies, concurrency, and protection. The design and implementation of a simple operating system are performed. This course focuses on teaching the skills required to design and build modules of an operating system kernel. It covers key algorithms and architectures. A companion course, CSE 320, teaches complementary skills from the application programmer&#39;s point of view.
