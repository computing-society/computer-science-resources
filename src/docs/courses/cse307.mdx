title: CSE 307 - Principles of Programming Languages
description: Principles of Programming Languages
---

Presents examples of important programming languages and paradigms such as LISP, ALGOL, ADA , ML, Prolog, and C++. Students write sample programs in some of the languages studied. The languages are used to illustrate programming language constructs such as binding, binding times, data types and implementation, operations (assignment data-type creation, pattern matching), data control, storage management, parameter passing, and operating environment. The suitability of these various languages for particular programming tasks is also covered.
