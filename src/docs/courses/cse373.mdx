title: CSE 373 - Analysis of Algorithms
description: Analysis of Algorithms
---

Mathematical analysis of a variety of computer algorithms including searching, sorting, matrix multiplication, fast Fourier transform, and graph algorithms. Time and space complexity. Upper-bound, lower- bound, and average-case analysis. Introduction to NP completeness. Some machine computation is required for the implementation and comparison of algorithms. This course is offered as CSE 373 and MAT 373.
