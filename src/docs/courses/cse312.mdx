This course deals with the impact of computers on us as individuals and on our society. Rapid changes in computing technology and in our use of that technology have changed the way we work, play, and interact with other people. These changes have created a flood of new social and legal issues that demand critical examination. For example, technologies such as Gmail, Facebook, MySpace, along with music sharing sites and wikis create new social, ethical, and legal issues. This course is offered as both CSE 312 and ISE 312.
